Below is a concise, production-ready prompt you can paste into a code-generation tool or hand to a developer to implement the requested portfolio as a **Flask** app using **only Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It contains file structure, exact UI/UX requirements, data placeholders you will fill later, and clear functional expectations.

# Flask Portfolio Generator — Instructions

Goal
Create a production-ready, responsive portfolio web app built with **Flask (Python)** for the backend and **plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the front end. **Do not use any frontend frameworks or CSS frameworks**. Keep the design white-based, minimal, premium, and corporate. Use subtle accent color(s), soft shadows, rounded corners, and smooth, restrained animations.

Strict tech constraints

* Backend: Python + Flask only (no additional web frameworks).
* Frontend: plain HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript only.
* Files to produce exactly:

  * `app.py` (Flask app)
  * `requirements.txt` (containing `Flask`)
  * `templates/index.html`
  * `static/css/style.css`
  * `static/js/script.js`
  * `static/images/` (placeholder images for profile, cert thumbnails, project thumbnails)
* No external JS frameworks, no Bootstrap, no Tailwind, etc. Google Fonts may be loaded in HTML.

Project structure (required)

```
/project-root
  ├─ app.py
  ├─ requirements.txt
  ├─ templates/
  │   └─ index.html
  ├─ static/
  │   ├─ css/
  │   │   └─ style.css
  │   ├─ js/
  │   │   └─ script.js
  │   └─ images/
  │       └─ (placeholders)
```

Data placeholders (you will replace these with your content)

* `{{NAME}}` — Full name
* `{{ROLE}}` — Role / job title
* `{{TAGLINE}}` — Short impactful tagline
* `{{PROFILE_IMAGE}}` — profile image path (placeholder)
* `{{RESUME_FILE}}` — resume PDF in `/static/` for download
* `{{BIO_PARAGRAPH}}` — two-paragraph professional biography (for About)
* `{{CERTIFICATES}}` — array of certificates **only from websites**; each item: `{ "title": "...", "platform": "...", "year": YYYY, "thumbnail": "path" }`
* `{{PROJECTS}}` — array of projects; each item: `{ "title": "...", "summary": "...", "tech": "HTML, Python, Flask", "link": "https://..." or null, "thumbnail": "path" }`
* `{{CONTACT_EMAIL}}`, `{{CONTACT_PHONE}}`, `{{CONTACT_LOCATION}}`

> Leave the exact lists empty if not provided; generator should render placeholders and comments where to populate.

Design & UX requirements (must implement)

* Theme: white background, subtle accent color, modern sans-serif (Inter or Poppins via Google Fonts).
* Typography hierarchy and spacing must be clear and consistent.
* Sticky top navigation with smooth-scroll to sections and active-state highlight.
* Hero section: name, role, tagline, profile image placeholder, two CTA buttons: **Download Resume** and **Contact Me** (scrolls to contact). Include high-end, subtle hero animations (fade/slide).
* About section: two-column layout on desktop (text + image).
* Skills section: animated horizontal progress bars with **exact** skill names and percentages:

  * Python — 90%
  * Flask — 75%
  * Artificial Intelligence — 85%
  * Machine Learning — 70%
  * HTML — 60%
    Trigger the animation using **Intersection Observer** when the section scrolls into view.
* Certifications section: show **only** online certificates (from websites). Each certificate card must show title, issuing website/platform, year, and thumbnail placeholder. Card hover elevation + polished layout.
* Achievements section: **must include these three items exactly** (render as award-style cards with iconography and subtle animations):

  * IIC Regional Meet 2025 — Participation
  * ISC Topper — English & Commerce
  * Winner — Trivia Titans
* Projects section: list project cards with title, one-line summary, tech stack, external link if provided, smooth hover animations.
* Contact section: functional contact form with fields Name, Email, Message. On submit, the Flask backend should validate input, store the message to a local file (e.g., `messages.json` or `messages.csv` in project root), and return a JSON response to the front end. Also display static contact details (email, phone, location). Do not implement sending real email unless credentials are provided; storing locally is acceptable and preferred.
* Footer: minimal with social links and copyright.

Animations & interactions

* Use Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered reveal/fade-up animations.
* Use subtle CSS transitions for hover states and smooth active nav highlighting.
* Keep animations lightweight and professional — fade-ins, slide-ups, and gentle transforms only.

Accessibility & responsiveness

* Fully responsive: mobile-first considerations, hamburger menu (pure CSS/vanilla JS) for small screens.
* Semantic HTML5 tags (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`, etc.).
* Buttons and links must be keyboard-accessible with visible focus states.

Backend behavior (Flask)

* `app.py` must serve:

  * `GET /` — renders `index.html`, injecting the data placeholders for templating (use Jinja to fill data passed from `app.py`).
  * `POST /contact` — accepts form submission JSON or form-encoded data; validate `name`, `email`, and `message` server-side; on success append message to `messages.json` and return `{"status":"success","message":"Thanks — message received"}` with HTTP 200; on validation error return HTTP 400 with JSON error.
  * `GET /resume` — serve the resume PDF file in static (or link to `/static/resume.pdf`) with proper `Content-Disposition` for download.
* Keep dependencies minimal. `requirements.txt` should contain `Flask==` latest stable (or simply `Flask`).

HTML/CSS/JS specifics

* `templates/index.html`:

  * Use Jinja placeholders to inject the data placeholders listed above.
  * Load Google Font (Inter or Poppins).
  * Include meta viewport and semantic markup.
* `static/css/style.css`:

  * Organized sections (variables for colors, spacing).
  * Responsive grid/flex rules, soft shadows, rounded corners, consistent spacing and sizes.
  * CSS for progress bars and animated fills (driven by adding a class from JS when in view).
* `static/js/script.js`:

  * Smooth scrolling behavior for nav links.
  * Intersection Observer to reveal sections and animate skill bars.
  * Mobile nav toggle.
  * AJAX `fetch` for contact form POST to `/contact` with client-side validation and user feedback (success/error toasts).
  * Highlight current nav item based on scroll position.

Code quality & comments

* All files must be well-formatted and commented where necessary.
* Use semantic, readable class names (BEM-like or similar) and keep CSS modular by section.
* Avoid inline styles; keep CSS in `style.css`.

Security & production notes

* Sanitize and validate form data on server side.
* When saving messages locally, ensure file is appended safely (use file locking or atomic write pattern).
* Do not commit any secrets (API keys, SMTP creds) into the code. If email sending is later requested, require explicit secrets provided via environment variables.

Run instructions (to include in README or as comments)

1. Create virtualenv and install:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run:

   ```
   export FLASK_APP=app.py         # Windows: set FLASK_APP=app.py
   flask run
   ```
3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

Deliverables (exact files to return)

* `app.py`
* `requirements.txt`
* `templates/index.html`
* `static/css/style.css`
* `static/js/script.js`
* `static/images/` placeholder images
* Optional: `messages.json` (created at runtime), `static/resume.pdf` placeholder

Final notes for the generator

* Use the exact Skills and percentages above (do not change names or values).
* Ensure Achievements section contains the three items **exactly** as written.
* Certifications must be only from websites/platforms — verify the `platform` field is non-empty in each certificate item.
* Keep UI minimal, premium, and white-based — no dark mode.
* Return only the files listed above; do not include extra frameworks or build steps.

Use this prompt as the single source input. Replace the `{{...}}` placeholders with your personal data before generating code, or provide them to the implementer separately. If you want, I can now generate the full Flask app code (all files above) populated with placeholder content so you can replace it with your real data — say the word and I’ll produce all files.
